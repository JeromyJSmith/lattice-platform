# LATTICE Platform — Agent Instructions
# Read by: Codex CLI (every session), GitHub Copilot, Cursor, any AI agent
# Keep under 32 KiB — Codex truncates silently above project_doc_max_bytes

## Project identity

LATTICE is an AI-native landscape-architecture digital twin:

**Pipeline:** Vectorworks 2026 → IFC4.3 → iTwin OSS BIS/geometry (self-hosted) →
deck.gl + Cesium 3D Tiles → Pixeltable knowledge substrate

**Repo:** https://github.com/JeromyJSmith/lattice-platform
**Active branch:** `feature/phase-c-linear` (integration branch — PRs target this, not main)
**Linear board:** https://linear.app/00-command-center/project/lattice-fa64d0d31078
**Issue prefix:** `MARPA-XX` (all platform and engagement issues use MARPA team)

Any capable coding agent can pick up any open issue. Attribution is by Linear
comment and PR author, not by file-path jurisdiction.

---

## Hard prohibitions (apply to every agent, no exceptions)

The only things no agent — human or AI — may do without an explicit, separate
human decision:

1. **Edit a landed migration.** Migrations `pixeltable/migrations/0001`–`0016`
   are immutable. To change schema, add the next sequential file (next = `0017`).
2. **Touch secrets, `.env*`, or OAuth credentials.** Always human.
3. **Modify branch protection rules.** Always human.
4. **Merge to `main`.** Always human.
5. **Delete migrations, branches, or Linear issues.** Always human.
6. **Change `.claude/rules/` doctrine files as a side-effect.** Doctrine changes
   are the explicit point of a PR or they don't happen.

Everything else — any file, any directory — is in scope for any agent that
picks up the issue.

---

## Non-negotiable code rules

### 1. Pixeltable geometry

```python
# CORRECT
centroid = pxt.String   # stores "POINT(-105.2705 40.0150)"

# WRONG — pxt.Geometry does not exist in Pixeltable 0.6.x — runtime crash
centroid = pxt.Geometry
```

### 2. Write-once migrations

- Migrations `0001`–`0016` are immutable.
- **Next migration number: `0017`**
- File format: `pixeltable/migrations/0017_<description>.py`
- Always use the helpers — never raw `pxt.create_*`:

```python
from pixeltable.migrations._helpers import (
    ensure_namespace, ensure_table, ensure_column, OWNED_PARENTS
)
# New top-level namespace? Add it to OWNED_PARENTS first.
```

### 3. When you add a migration — update all four files in the same commit

- `meta/SCHEMA.md` — table reference + migration trail entry
- `meta/ARCHITECTURE.md` — schema overview + verified-state header
- `CLAUDE.md` (repo root) — LIVE STATE block migration count
- `meta/HANDOFF.md` — current-state header

`docs-sync-check.yml` will block the PR if these drift.

### 4. When you add an endpoint — update both files in the same commit

- `meta/API.md` — endpoint table (current count: 33)
- `meta/ARCHITECTURE.md` — FastAPI surface table + endpoint count

### 5. Python: uv only

```bash
uv run python script.py
uv add package
uv sync

# NEVER: pip / pip3 / conda / poetry / pipenv
```

### 6. iTwin: OSS only

```ts
// ALLOWED
import { Point3d, Transform } from "@itwin/core-geometry";
import { Code, ElementProps } from "@itwin/core-common";

// FORBIDDEN — pulls in the SQLite persistence layer
import { IModelHost, SnapshotDb, BriefcaseDb } from "@itwin/core-backend";
```

Commercial Bentley tiers (BDN, iTwin Activate, Partner Program) are gated under
`meta/harness/docs/research/_gated/bentley-commercial/` and dormant by default.

### 7. No Anthropic SDK in client code

```ts
// WRONG — never in .ts/.tsx client files
import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";

// RIGHT — TanStack AI adapters or server functions only
import { useAIStream } from "@tanstack/ai";
```

### 8. All coordinates EPSG-normalised before Pixeltable write

Never write raw Vectorworks internal coordinates. Normalize through
`ifcopenshell.util.placement` or PDAL reprojection first.

### 9. No comments unless the WHY is non-obvious

Default: write zero comments. Add one only when there is a hidden constraint,
a workaround for a specific external bug, or behavior that would surprise a
reader. Never explain WHAT the code does.

## Mandatory pre-commit check

Before **every** `git commit`:

```bash
bash scripts/pre-commit-docs-check.sh
```

If it fails, fix the docs/counts first. `docs-sync-check.yml` CI enforces the
same check and will block the PR.

---

## Branch and PR format

**Branch:** `<type>/marpa-<NNN>-<2-4-word-slug>`
where `<type>` is `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `refactor`, or `test`.
Example: `feat/marpa-47-0017-scene-graph-embeddings`

**PR title:** `[MARPA-NNN] type(scope): description`
- type: `feat` | `fix` | `chore` | `refactor` | `test`
- scope: `migration` | `service` | `routes` | `scripts` | `docs` | `ci`
- Example: `[MARPA-47] feat(migration): 0017_scene_graph_embeddings`

**PR base branch:** `feature/phase-c-linear` (never `main`)

**Magic Words in PR body:**
- `Closes MARPA-NNN` → closes the Linear issue on merge
- `Refs MARPA-NNN` → links without closing

**PR template:** `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` auto-populates. Fill in the
Linear issue number.

**CI that must pass before marking Done:**
- `docs-sync-check` — migration/endpoint counts, forbidden strings
- `linear-sync-check` — PR title format `[MARPA-NNN]`

---

## Linear workpad pattern

When working an issue, maintain exactly **one** persistent comment on the
Linear issue throughout your work session.

- **Create** it with `commentCreate` on your first turn
- **Update** it with `commentUpdate` on every subsequent turn — never create
  additional comments

Required sections:

```
## Plan
[What you are doing and why]

## Acceptance Criteria
[How you will verify completion]

## Progress
[Current step — what's done, what's next]

## Confusions / Blockers
[Anything needing human input — surface immediately, don't bury]
```

## Canonical reference files — read before writing any code

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `meta/ARCHITECTURE.md` | System overview, namespace map, FastAPI surface, iTwin tier map |
| `meta/SCHEMA.md` | Pixeltable table reference and migration trail (source of truth for migration numbers) |
| `meta/API.md` | FastAPI endpoint table (update when adding routes) |
| `meta/sync-contract.md` | Linear ↔ GitHub field directions, Magic Words, PR title convention |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Full cardinal rules (authoritative) |
| `.github/agent-context.md` | Flat snapshot of locked stack + cardinal rules (use when meta/ tree is unavailable) |

If the task requires an architectural decision not covered by these files,
post a blocker comment on the Linear issue and move it back to Todo. Do not
invent architecture.

---

## What LATTICE is NOT

Do not propose or implement any of the following:

- Revit, MicroStation, DGN, or `.rvt` file handling
- `@itwin/core-backend`, `SnapshotDb`, `BriefcaseDb`, `IModelHost`
- `pxt.Geometry` anywhere in migration files
- Any Bentley cloud-hosted API (iTwin SaaS, BDN, Activate cohort) unless a gate has fired
- Cesium ion paid endpoints unless Gate E has fired
- `pip install` / `conda install` / `poetry add` for Python deps
- SQLite, PostgreSQL, or Redis as a primary store — Pixeltable only
- Raw Vectorworks internal coordinates written to Pixeltable
- Anthropic SDK imported in `.ts` or `.tsx` client files
- Editing an existing migration file

---

## Session start checklist

Before substantive work, verify:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8001/health    # FastAPI sidecar
git status                              # clean tree
git fetch origin                        # sync remote
```

If the sidecar is not running:

```bash
cd pixeltable/service
PIXELTABLE_HOME=/Volumes/PixelTable/.pixeltable \
PYTHONPATH=/Volumes/PixelTable/schemas \
uv run python main.py &
```
